# Fast Read Website

**Website:** [logan-roelofs.github.io/fast-read-website/](https://logan-roelofs.github.io/fast-read-website/)

I learned about RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) recently and found that most of the tools online weren't what I was looking for, so I made this website for myself. RSVP REALLY helps out with my dyslexia + I think it's fun making these little one-off websites.

## Cool Features
- Read against your full text to see how much faster reading with RSVP is
- Change your reading speed
- Skip forward or back 30 words
- Save text locally during your sessions for re-reading

## Future Plans (if others are interested in this)
- Make a settings tab to make the reading screen cleaner
- Add more settings like text size
- Different fonts, more in particular OpenDyslexic font
- Colors - black and white don't work for everyone
- Make a feature that takes a bit longer on longer words and a bit shorter on shorter words

Thanks for checking out the site! This was a little day project I had fun making.
